        "name": "InfraVest Taiwan Wind Farms Bundled Project 2011 - Taiwan",
        "description": "The InfraVest Taiwan Wind Farms Bundled Project 2011(hereinafter referred to as “the project”) is a bundled project of four wind farms projects:\r\n• InfraVest Fongwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 13.8 MW (6x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Hsinfong Township (therefore also called Hsinfong Wind Farm), Hsinchu County, which comprises 6 wind turbines (hereafter: Fongwei Wind Farm).\r\n• InfraVest Longwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 44.1 MW (18x2.3 MW + 3x0.9 MW) onshore wind farm located in Houlong Township (therefore also called Houlong Wind Farm), Miaoli County, which comprises 21 wind turbines (hereafter: Longwei Wind Farm).\r\n• InfraVest Chungwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 29.9 MW (13x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Dajia and Da-An Townships, Taichung County, which covers Taichung phases I and III, and Dafong sites, and which comprises 13 wind turbines (hereafter: Chungwei Wind Farm). There are another 20 wind turbines also located in Dajia and Da- An Townships, Taichung County, which belong to the same project owner. But these 20 turbines belong to the project owner’s another GS VER project (GS472), which was already registered in 2010. Therefore, the 13 wind turbines in Chungwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS472).\r\n• InfraVest Tauwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 4.6 MW (2x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Guanyin Township (also called Hsinwu Wind Farm), Taoyuan County, which comprises 2 wind turbines (hereafter: Tauwei Wind Farm). There are another 19 wind turbines also located in Guanyin Township, Taoyuan County, which belong to the same project owner. But these 19 turbines belong to the project owner’s another GS VER project (GS612), which was already registered in 2011. Therefore, the 2 wind turbines in Tauwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS612).\r\nThe above-mentioned four wind farms are constructed and operated by InfraVest Wind Power Group (hereafter refer as “InfraVest”), which is a subsidiary of Germany based VWind AG. The project in total comprises 42 wind turbines and the total installed capacity of the bundled project is 92.4 MW. At full capacity, the aggregated output of the project is expected to be of 250,866 MWh/year, which is to be delivered to the state-owned power grid, Taipower grid (“TPG”), displacing part of the electricity supplied by the power grid currently dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants. Accordingly, the project will lead to carbon dioxide emission reduction. The annual emission reductions are estimated as 190,908 tCO2e/year, and the total emission reductions for the first crediting period of 7 years are estimated as 1,336,356 tCO2e.",
